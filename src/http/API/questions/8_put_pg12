				<p>A colleague at work had a small boat in which every weekend <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="OK" maxlength="32" readonly></p>

			<div>
				<p>he used to go for sailing. He invited myself and a friend to go <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="for" maxlength="32" readonly></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>

			<div>
				<p>with him on a sailing trip. We imagined that ourselves sitting on <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="" id="a801" maxlength="32"></p>
			</div>
			<br/>
			<div>
				<p>the deck of the boat, near a beach, sunbathing and doing what we <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="" id="a802" maxlength="32"></p>

			<br/>
			<div>
				<p>wanted. But the reality was much more different. Our friend, who <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="" id="a803" maxlength="32"></p>
			</div>
			<br/>
			<div>
				<p>owned it the boat, wanted to do some real sailing and was only <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="" id="a804" maxlength="32"></p>

			<div>
				<p>happy with at sea. As a result, we were actually at sea most <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="" id="a805" maxlength="32"></p>

			<br/>
			<div>
				<p>of the time. To make matters the worse our friend spent a lot <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="" id="a806" maxlength="32"></p>

			<br/>
			<div>
				<p>of the time shouting orders at us. Whatever was the weather <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="" id="a807" maxlength="32"></p>
			</div>
			<br/>
			<div>
				<p>we sailed on and on. We did get a tan but not from the sun, <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="" id="a808" maxlength="32"></p>

			<br/>
			<div>
				<p>it was from the strong winds in which blew cold sea water <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="" id="a809" maxlength="32"></p>
			</div>
			<br/>
			<div>
				<p>in our faces all day. We had been imagined a relaxing time <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="" id="a810" maxlength="32"></p>

			<br/>
			<div>
				<p>doing for nothing but it was not the case. Unfortunately, when <input type="text" placeholder="Your answer" value="" id="a811" maxlength="32"></p>
